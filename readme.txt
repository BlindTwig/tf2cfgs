This are my Team Fortress 2 class cfgs.

I like to keep it simple, so don't expect too fancy bindings. I tried to make
the bindings mostly non-intrusive so you can play like always, just with
additional functionality. I avoid the wait command, so those configs should
work on competitive servers, too.

There is are some unused snippets in the configs, I did not test those where
commented, I just wanted to have them for reference/future usage.

If you have any suggetions, improvements, bugs or questions, add me on Steam:

Most bindings are for mice with at least 5 buttons and mostly change mouse keys.

Disclaimer: USE ON YOUR OWN RISK.

  back to last weapon, sensitivity increase on holding alt
