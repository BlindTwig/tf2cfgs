These are my own configs I made for playing TF2, based on the configs made by Andreas Fritsch.
Most of the original work is from them, I only modified these to my own liking and made a fork just to keep these uploaded somewhere safe and easy to find again, should my PC shit the bed for any reason.

Go check out their original repo! I think I outright removed some features compared to it, can't be bothered to find what and restore them.
