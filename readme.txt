This are my Team Fortress 2 class cfgs.

I like to keep it simple, so don't expect too fancy bindings. I tried to make the bindings non-intrusive so you can
play like always, just with additional functionality. I stay away from the wait command, to prevent errors on servers
where it is deactivated.
There is are some unused snippets in the configs, I did not test the ones in demoman and pyro, I just wanted to have
them for reference/future usage.

If you have any suggetions, improvements, bugs or questions, add me on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/sonomabob

Most bindings are for mice with at least 5 buttons and mostly change mouse keys.

Disclaimer: USE ON YOUR OWN RISK.


Features:
- All classes (except specifically changed): panicmelee on mouse3 hold, then back to last weapon
- Spy: autosap when holding mouse5, when releasing back to last weapon
- Heavy: toggle machinemode (duck+attack) with mouse5, useful for MvM and besides dispensers
- Engineer: quick build+destroy on keys 1-4 when holding alt
- Sniper: sensitivity change when holding alt (increase for in my case), quick jarate on mouse5
- Soldier: Announce enemy medic kill on mouse5, easy rocketjump on mouse2 (deactivated)
- Pyro: nothing atm, I think panicmelee is fine
- Scout: mouse1-3 direct change+attack for all three weapons
- Medic: mouse3 fake ubercharge, mouse5 team announce ubercharge is ready, backspace kill, mouse2 announce popped
  ubercharge
- Demoman: nothing atm, except panicmelee
